* Mop 
Notes on the implementation of three CLOS MOPs.

The practical end goal is to understand the CLOS
MOP it so well that I will be able to port it to 
something like the JSCL Lisp-to-Javascript compiler.

** Tiny-Clos Scheme
The first version of Tiny CLOS we will look at is the
Scheme version written by Gregor Kiczales. The latest
update I have on this is 8/9/94. It was found at the
following weblink:

** Tiny-Clos Common Lisp 
The second version of Tiny CLOS we will look at is the
Common Lisp version written by Gregor Kiczales.

** Closette
Closette is the full blooded Common Lisp version that
is described in Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres and
Daniel G. Bobrow's classic work /The Art of the Metaobject Protocol/,
or /AMOP/ as it is known throughout the Lisp community.
