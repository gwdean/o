/Tags/ make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.

If a heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit
the tag as well.

For example, in the list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Meeting with the French group     :work:
** Summary by Frank                 :boss:notes:
*** TODO Prepare slides for him     :action:
#+END_EXAMPLE

the final heading will have the tags :work:boss:notes:action:

You can also set tags that all entries in a file should
inherit by including the following line:

#+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:
