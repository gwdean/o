This document contains notes on Section 6.4 ("Programming with constraints")
of Tom Dean's /Talking with Computers/.

/Constraint programming/ is a model of computation that was an important 
influence on object-oriented programming languages. The following algebra
problem shows the basic idea of how constraint programming works.

** Problem
The living room in Anne's house is 56 square meters. She wants to buy a rug
that fits exactly in the room. Along one side of the room is a 3-meter-wide
fireplace flanked by two identical bookcases that together take up the
entire width of the room. The bookcases are 2 meters wide each. The fireplace
and two bookcases are built into the wall and don't cover any floor space.
What are the dimensions of the rug that Anne should buy.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Known and unknown quantities
----------------------------
living_room_area = 56
bookcase_width   = 2
fireplace_width  = 3
living_room_width = fireplace_width + (2 * bookcase_width)

General relationships
---------------------
living_room_area = living_room_length * living_room_width 

living_room_length = living_room_area / living_room_width

living_room_length = living_room_area / (fireplace_width + (2 * bookcase_width))

The idea of constraint programming emerged from the work
of Ivar Sutherland in the 1960's while working on /Sketchpad/.

Sutherland was interested in displaying graphical objects and
he wanted to specify general constraints (equations) governing
their position and orientation and have the computer figure out
the consequences of those constraints in drawing the objects
on the computer screen.

For example, at one point you might say that two rectangles
should be drawn so that one is above the other, and later you
might add that the bottom of one should be aligned with the
top of the other, and later you might add that the bottom of
one should be aligned
