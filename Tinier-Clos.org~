What is TINY-CLOS?

A very simple CLOS-like language, embedded in
Scheme, with a simple MOP.

The features of this default base language are:

- Classes
- Multiple Inheritance
- Generic functions 
- Primary methods and call-next-method
- Class, generic function and methods are first class (meta)objects.

While the MOP is simple, it is *essentially equal* in
power to both the MOPs in AMOP.

In addition to calling a generic (?), the entry points
to the default base language are:

(MAKE-CLASS)
(MAKE-GENERIC)
(MAKE-METHOD)
(ADD-METHOD)

(MAKE class . initargs)
(INITIALIZE instance initargs)

(SLOT-REF  object slot-name)
(SLOT-SET! object slot-name new-value) 

The introspective part of the MOP

CLASS-OF

CLASS-DIRECT-SUPERS
CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS
CLASS-CPL
CLASS-SLOTS

GENERIC-METHODS

METHOD-SPECIALIZERS
METHOD-PROCEDURE

The intercessory protocol looks like (generics in uppercase):
