* The export dispatcher (135)
All export commands can be reached using the
*export dispatcher* (a prefix key that prompts
for an additional key specifying the command.)

=C-c C-e=     -> Dispatcher for export and publishing commands
=C-c C-e v=   -> Like =C-c C-e=, but only export the text that is currently visible

* HTML export (136)
Org-mode contains an (X)HTML exporter with extensive
HTML formatting, in ways similar to John Gruber's /markdown/
language, but with additional support for tables.

** HTML export commands
(C-c C-e h) -> export as HTML file 'yo.html'
(C-c C-e b) -> export as HTML file and immediately open it with a browser.
(C-c C-e H) -> export to a temporary buffer. Do not create a file.
