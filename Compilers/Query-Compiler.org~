* A Query Compiler
An implementation of the compiler described in Paul Graham's
/On Lisp/, pages 246-257.

The compiler is implemented as an /embedded language/. An
embedded language is not implemented by a traditional 
compiler or interpreter, but instead is implemented within
some existing language, often by transformation. 

The construction of the compiler proceeds in two parts.
First the system is implemented as an interpreter. After
the interpreter is completed, it is reimplemented as 
a query compiler (essentially one big macro) which makes
the system more efficient and better integrated with Lisp.
