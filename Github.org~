GitHub is an amazing system, but it is often
difficult to wrap one's head around it. I have
been on the fringes of GitHub since I first
discovered it in 2009. I've made a few gists
here and there, added some repositories
done some branching, made a few commits, etc,
but I still do not feel fluent in this technology. 

The goal for me in writing this document is to
gain fluency in GitHub.
