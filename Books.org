* Books.org
An iterative approach to developing a database
for organizing books. 

Here is the list of books. 

(2013 Touretzky tour *TOUR*)
(2011 Barski    bars *BARS*)
(2005 Seibel    seib *SEIB*)
(1996 Graham    gra2 *GRA2*)
(1994 Graham    gra1 *GRA1*)
(1989 Keene     keen *KEEN*)

There are many ways we can organize these books. 
Our first example draws from *TOUR*, chapter 6,
/List Data Structures./

Section 6.8, called *LISTS AS TABLES* give us an
simple way to organize our books.
