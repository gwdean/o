* Experimental Code
This document collects a variety of code samples
that do not have any immediate purpose, but are
cool and/or may be useful somewhere down the road.

** Mutually Recursive Acronyms
This list of mutually recursive acronyms  is taken 
from Douglas Hofstadter's article in Scientific 
American called "Lisp, Recursion and Generality".
