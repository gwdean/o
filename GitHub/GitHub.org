GitHub is an amazing system, but it is often
difficult to wrap one's head around it. I have
been on the fringes of GitHub since I first
discovered it in 2009. I've made a few gists
here and there, added some repositories
done some branching, made a few commits, etc,
but I still do not feel fluent in this technology. 

The goal for me in writing this document is to
gain fluency in GitHub.

So here's the state of my knowledge as of right
now. This document, "Github.org", is the latest
addition to the https://github.com/gwdean/o
repository. 

The resource I am using to gain fluency is /Pro Git/,
by Scott Chacon: http://git-scm.com/book

So let's review my setup so far.

Org is used for most of the programming
GitHub is where the public parts are displayed.

The Pro Git book is divided into several parts,
as follows:

Getting Started
Git Basics
Git Branching
Git on the Server
Distributed Git
Git Tools
Customizing Git
Git and Other Systems
Git Internals
Index of Commands
